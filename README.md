This is my first completed project in C++ SFML

To make your own Music Square map:
1. Find MIDI file of your song (first note must be at 0.0, desync otherwise)
2. Convert it to ogg
3. Put both files into resources/songs folder
4. Run app.exe

Also you can config settings via resources/config.ini file
